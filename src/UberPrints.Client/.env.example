# Development Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env for local development

# API Configuration
# For development with Vite dev server, you can either:
# 1. Leave empty to use Vite proxy (configured in vite.config.ts) - RECOMMENDED
# 2. Set to backend URL directly (e.g., http://localhost:5203)
#
# For production builds, create a .env.production file with VITE_API_BASE_URL=
# This ensures production uses relative URLs (same-origin requests)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# Discord OAuth Configuration
# These are only needed if implementing client-side OAuth flow (currently not used)
# VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your-discord-client-id
# VITE_DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
